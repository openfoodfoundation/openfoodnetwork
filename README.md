# Open Food Network

The Open Food Network is an online marketplace for local food. It enables a network of independent online food stores that connects farmers and food hubs (including co-ops, online farmers markets, independent food businesses, etc) with individuals and local businesses. It gives farmers and food hubs an easier and fairer way to distribute their food.

Supported by the Open Food Foundation and a network of global affiliates, we are proudly open source and not-for-profit - we're trying to seriously disrupt the concentration of power in global agri-food systems, and we need as many smart people working together on this as possible.

We're part of global movement - get involved!

## Contributing

If you are interested in contributing to the OFN in any capacity, please introduce yourself [on Slack][slack-invite], and have a look through the [OFN Handbook][ofn-handbook].

Our [GETTING_STARTED](GETTING_STARTED.md) and [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guides are the best place to start for developers looking to set up a development environment and make contributions to the codebase.

### Hacktoberfest :tada:

Are you participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)? Go check out our [Welcome New Developers project board][welcome-dev]! We have curated all issues we consider to be a good starting point for new members of the community and categorized them by skills and level of complexity. 
Have a look and pick the one you would prefer working on!

## Provisioning

If you're interested in provisioning a server, see [ofn-install][ofn-install] for the project's Ansible playbooks.

We also have a [Super Admin Guide][super-admin-guide] to help with configuration of new servers.

## Testing

If you'd like to help out with testing, please introduce yourself on the #testing channel on [Slack][slack-invite] and download the [ZenHub browser extension][zenhub] to view the development pipeline. Also, do have a look in our [Welcome New QAs board][welcome-qa] for some good first issues, both on manual and automated testing (RSpec/Capybara).

We use [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) as a manual testing tool. BrowserStack provides open source projects with unlimited and free of charge accounts. A big thanks to them!


We use [KnapsackPro](https://knapsackpro.com/) for optimal parallelisation of our automated tests. KnapsackPro offers unlimited plans for non-commercial open source projects, like ours - a big thanks to them!
