  modal_how: "How it works"
  modal_how_shop: Shop the Open Food Network
  modal_how_shop_explained: Search for a food hub near you to start shopping! You can expand each food hub to see what kinds of goodies are available, and click through to start shopping. (You can only shop one food hub at a time.)
  modal_how_pickup: Pick-ups, delivery and shipping costs
  modal_how_pickup_explained: Some food hubs deliver to your door, while others require you to pick-up your purchases. You can see which options are available on the homepage, and select which you'd like at the shopping and check-out pages. Delivery will cost more, and pricing differs from hub-to-hub. Each food hub is a sales point with independent business operations and logisitics - so variations between hubs are to be expected.

Our goal is to support the distribution of as much local food as possible. As such OFN UK asks users to 'Pay What You Feel' toward the running costs and maintenance. We think 2% of sales is fair for all the services that OFN UK provide. But more importantly, we think that getting good local food to people at a fair price is more important than paying for software. So pay what you feel our services are worth to your enterprise.\n\nWe collectively budget for new feature development from the international OFN community. This way the huge cost of good software development can be shared. If you want a new feature, chances are someone in France, South Africa, Australia, India or Brazil might want it too! Use the Community Forum to suggest features you'd like to see."
