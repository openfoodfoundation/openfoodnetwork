# frozen_string_literal: true

# Representation of an enterprise being part of an order cycle.
#
# A producer can be part as supplier. The supplier's products can be selected to
# be available in the order cycle (incoming products).
#
# A selling enterprise can be part as distributor. The order cycle then appears
# in its shopfront. Any incoming product can be selected to be shown in the
# shopfront (outgoing products). But the set of shown products can be smaller
# than all incoming products.
